## Overview

Solar2D's `gameNetwork` library provides access to social gaming features such as public leaderboards and achievements.


## [Apple Game Center][plugin.gameNetwork-apple]

__Apple Game Center__ for iOS lets friends in on the action with leaderboards and achievements. For more information, see [Game Center for Developers](https://developer.apple.com/game-center/). Note that the nomenclature used in the Solar2D APIs for Game&nbsp;Center attempt to match the official Game&nbsp;Center APIs as much as possible, allowing you to <nobr>cross-reference</nobr> with official Game&nbsp;Center documentation.

For implementation details, please see the <nobr>Apple Game Center</nobr> [plugin documentation][plugin.gameNetwork-apple].


## [Google Play Games Services][plugin.gpgs]

__Google Play Games Services__ makes your games more social with capabilities for achievements, leaderboards, and other popular features using the [Google Play Games Services](https://developers.google.com/games/services) SDK.

For implementation details, please see the <nobr>Google Play Games Services</nobr> [plugin documentation][plugin.gpgs-v2].
