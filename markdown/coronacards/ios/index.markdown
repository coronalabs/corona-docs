# CORONA_CARDS_PRODUCT &mdash; iOS

Using CORONA_CARDS_PRODUCT, your existing iOS app can leverage the full power of CORONA_CORE_PRODUCT via one or more <nobr>CORONA_CORE_PRODUCT-based</nobr> views (`CoronaView`). These views are based on the iOS `GLKView` and can be inserted into the `UIView` hierarchy. They can be sized as partial or <nobr>full-screen</nobr> just like any other `UIView` and may even be shown as transparent overlays on top of existing content.


## System Requirements

* macOS 10.11 or later
* Xcode (minimum version allowed by Apple to submit apps to the App Store)
