Deployment is the culmination of all your hard work. Those hours of designing, programming, and testing have yielded a game that's ready to show to the world! In this chapter we'll discuss a few final considerations before publishing, as well as summarize the steps required for deployment.

## Icons

<div class="float-right" style="max-width: 180px; margin-top: 2px; clear: left;">

![][images.docs.sbs-starexplorer-icon]

</div>

Each of the app stores &mdash; the [Apple App Store](https://www.apple.com/appstore)&trade;, [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store)&trade;, [Amazon Appstore](https://www.amazon.com/mobile-apps/b/ref=topnav_storetab_mas?ie=UTF8&node=2350149011)&trade;, etc.&nbsp;&mdash; has different __icon__ requirements and each requests various sizes and design considerations for different devices. There are several online services that will automatically create the entire set of required icons in the correct sizes, although you may wish to design them all yourself. Remember, these will be relatively small in size when they visually represent your app on an actual device, so fine details might be lost.

</div>

You can find a full list of required icons for each platform [here][guide.distribution.buildSettings#custom-app-icons]. In addition, we've included a full set of icons for mobile devices in this chapter's [source files](https://github.com/coronalabs/GettingStarted08/archive/master.zip).

<a id="yours"></a>

## Making it Yours

This tutorial, and Star&nbsp;Explorer in general, is a starter project that many people complete and potentially submit to the app stores. As a result, many people have deployed the same identical game to prospective players. While this is acceptable, you should consider how to change and customize this game so that it's __yours__, distinct in certain ways from the base template we've provided. Here are some ideas:

* Change the art/audio to suit your personal taste.

* Change the game title on the title screen and/or use a different background image.

* Utilize additional asteroid image frames from the `gameObjects.png` image sheet, randomly spawning one of the variations in the `createAsteroid()` function.

* Implement particle-based effects such as explosions and laser trails using Solar2D's <nobr>built-in</nobr> [display.newEmitter()][api.library.display.newEmitter] feature.

Once you have a game of your own (based on Star&nbsp;Explorer or some other code base), proceed to the next sections for details on testing and building.




<a id="live-builds"></a>

## Corona Live Builds

<div class="float-right" style="max-width: 330px; margin-bottom: 16px; clear: both;">

![][images.docs.corona-live-builds]

</div>

While the Solar2D Simulator is a great way to test your game during development, nothing quite compares to seeing it run on an actual device!

The best solution is <a href="https://docs.coronalabs.com/guide/distribution/liveBuild/index.html" target="_new">Corona Live Builds</a>. Using the power and speed of a local network, you can preview and test your game on multiple devices simultaneously, watching your game dynamically update as you edit its code and assets. With Corona&nbsp;Live&nbsp;Builds, you get <nobr>lightning-fast</nobr> development gratification.

To learn how to configure live builds, see the [Generating Live Builds][guide.distribution.liveBuild] guide.

<!--- END PLATFORM ICONS -->

Let's discuss building and publishing! You should always test your app on an actual device before submitting it to an app store. In fact, since this is your final phase of quality control, you should test on as many devices as possible.

The requirements are a little different depending on which platform you intend to deploy to, so we'll cover them separately.

### iOS

The first step in building for Apple&nbsp;iOS is __provisioning__, Apple's process for testing and distribution. You should follow the detailed instructions in the [Provisioning and Building â€” iOS][guide.distribution.iOSBuild] guide in order to test and deploy for iOS.

### Android

Deploying and publishing to the Google&nbsp;Play marketplace is a little different than Apple. Android uses a few specific naming conventions and has its own process for "signing" apps with your personal information. You can step through the entire process [here][guide.distribution.androidBuild].

### Kindle Fire

While Amazon's Kindle Fire is built upon the Android operating system, it has a few unique considerations for building. Complete instructions for building for Kindle&nbsp;Fire are available [here][guide.distribution.kindleBuild].

### Windows / macOS

Yes, you can even build your game as a Windows&nbsp;desktop or macOS&nbsp;desktop application! However, mobile apps and desktop apps operate very differently&nbsp;&mdash; you must consider how the app will run in a window, how to handle keyboard responses, if the game window can be resized, etc. Don't make the mistake of thinking that your game is ready for desktop deployment before studying the following guides:

* [Creating Win32 Desktop Apps][guide.distribution.win32Build]
* [Creating macOS Desktop Apps][guide.distribution.macOSBuild]

### Apple TV

Like desktop applications, there are several unique considerations which you must take into account before deploying your app to Apple&nbsp;TV. For detailed information, see the [Apple TV / tvOS][guide.distribution.tvos] guide.

### Android TV

Because Android apps are universal, it's simple to deploy to Android&nbsp;TV&nbsp;&mdash; just [build your app][guide.distribution.androidBuild] as a standard Android `.apk`, add two additional parameters to your `build.settings` file as outlined [here][guide.distribution.advancedSettings#android-tv], and include an Android&nbsp;TV banner as noted [here][guide.distribution.buildSettings#tvos-android-tv].

### Steam

To learn about deploying your desktop game to Steam, please see the [Steamworks plugin][plugin.steamworks] documentation.




## Congratulations!

You made it! Take a deep breath and be proud of how much you've learned in such a short time&nbsp;&mdash; you've built a complete game using Solar2D and you're ready to begin your grand adventure into the world of game creation. What enhancements can you add to Star&nbsp;Explorer to make it even better? How about making the large asteroids explode into a few smaller asteroids when they're hit? The game may also benefit from a few additional enemies to increase the challenge and variety.

What other ideas do you have? Do you want to make a puzzle game? A <nobr>point-and-click</nobr> adventure game? A platform game where you run, jump, collect coins, and avoid hazards to claim a prize? There's an endless variety of games you can make.

Thinking of <nobr>e-books</nobr> or educational apps? Want to build something <nobr>non-game-related</nobr> like a business or utility app? Solar2D can power these as well!

### Dream, Build, Ship!

Here are a few of the amazing apps built with Solar2D by creative dreamers just like you!

### Sharing the Love

One final note before you get back to working on your great app&nbsp;&mdash; please let us know when your app is in the store!

## Extra Credit

Short chapter to be added about:

1) Adding Flurry Analytics to your app to start tracking events because "your app will only be good as how you measure its success."
2) Adding push notifications into your app with OneSignal because it's easiest way to get your users to keep coming back to your app.
3) Adding attribution tracking via Kochava because it's important to know where your installs are coming from - organic and, if paid, which campaign.
