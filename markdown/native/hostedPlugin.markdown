# Self-Hosted Plugins

## Overview

CORONA_NATIVE_PRODUCT users can enable plugins hosted on third-party servers. This allows you to use third party plugins as well as creating plugins for internal use and leveraging Solar2D's rapid build process with native code that you've written.


## Packaging and Hosting

Plugins must be packaged for each platform __separately__ as a `.tgz` file and hosted on a web server.

### Flat File Structure

Follow the [Plugins][native.plugin] guide to build your plugin, then package the plugin on your server. The plugin needs to be stored in a flat (no&nbsp;directories) `.tgz` format. For example, from inside your plugin build folder, run:

	tar -czf myplugin.tgz myplugin.lua metadata.lua

### Web Server Requirements

Upload the resulting `.tgz` file to a web server that is accessible from the Internet. If necessary, `https://` and basic authentication are supported for security and access control.


## Solar2D Simulator and Builds

### Running Plugins in the Simulator

Solar2D Simulator only accesses hosted plugins for device builds. When it comes to running these plugins in the Simulator, you must install these plugins locally by placing the plugin file in the following directory:

	~/Library/Application Support/Corona/Simulator/Plugins/

This file should match the name used as the key in the `plugins` table, for example `"plugin.hostedplugin"` in the `build.settings` example below.


### Device Builds/Settings

In order to use hosted plugins with your Solar2D project, the following changes to `build.settings` must be made:

1. For each __device__ platform, you must tell Solar2D the URL from which to fetch the plugin `.tgz` file.

    In the `supportedPlatforms` table for the plugin, each platform property key's value should contain the URL pointing to the `.tgz` plugin file.

2. For each __Simulator__ platform, you must tell Solar2D __not__ to attempt download of a `.tgz` file.

    In the `supportedPlatforms` table for the plugin, the `macos` and `win32` key values should be `false`.

    If you wish to use the plugin in the Solar2D Simulator, you must install the plugin locally as noted above.

Here is an example of including a hosted plugin within `build.settings`:

``````lua
settings =
{
	plugins =
	{
		["plugin.hostedplugin"] =
		{
			publisherId = "com.company",
			supportedPlatforms = { 
				iphone = { url="https://test:abc123@example.com/plugin/iphone.tgz" },
				android = { url="https://test:abc123@example.com/plugin/android.tgz" },
				macos = false,
				win32 = false
			},
		},
	},
}
``````

* The maximum __compressed__ size for the `.tgz` file is 25&nbsp;MB. The maximum __uncompressed__ size for the `.tgz` file is 50&nbsp;MB.

* Solar2D Simulator will throw an error on launch/relaunch saying that the plugin couldn't be downloaded. This message is safe to ignore.
