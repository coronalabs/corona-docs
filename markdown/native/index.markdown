# CORONA_NATIVE_PRODUCT

CORONA_NATIVE_PRODUCT lets you extend CORONA_CORE_PRODUCT beyond the functionality provided by the CORONA_CORE_PRODUCT Lua&nbsp;APIs \([reference][api]\). For instance, you can use native languages like <nobr>Objective-C</nobr> or Java and pass information between the native code and Lua code. You can also [create plugins][native.plugin] that make it even easier to get native platform features into apps built with CORONA_CORE_PRODUCT.

If you don't need to include custom native code in your app, CORONA_CORE_PRODUCT Simulator is the best tool to use. Get started [here][guide.programming.01].
