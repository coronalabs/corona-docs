<p>If building for iOS, you must bypass App Transport Security (ATS) by adding the following to the <code>plist</code> table of <code>build.settings</code>. While Corona&nbsp;Labs does not blindly encourage this approach for all developers and projects, bypassing ATS is required in certain cases. For more information on ATS, please see the <a href="../../guide/hardware/appleATS/index.html">Managing App Transport Security</a> guide.</p>

<pre class="brush: lua;">settings =
{
	iphone =
	{
		plist =
		{
			NSAppTransportSecurity = { NSAllowsArbitraryLoads=true },
		},
	},
}</pre>
